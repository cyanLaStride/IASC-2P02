        <h2>1. Prisoners</h2>
        <p class="night">During the night, there was nothing. The prisoners used this time to sleep. The prisoners used this time to sleep. They had been confined here for as long as they could remember; they knew nothing else. Dawn came from the <span class="clickable" id="change1">left.</span></p>
        <p class="day">During the day, the prisoners woke and watched. Every day, there was a new blob. The blob would spawn on the left, and travel to the right, where it would <span class="clickable" id="change2">die.</span></p>
        <p id="final" class="hidden">One day, as a new blob was just spawning and the prisoners were deciding on what to name it, the eldest prisoner perked up. “Wait a second,” he gasped, “I know that blob! I remember it! That blob’s name is Jeremy!” The other prisoners stared at the blob, confused. Everyone knew that the blobs never came back. They asked him, “How do you know that one is Jeremy?”<br>
            “Well, he has just the same shape,” the old man replied. “Everyone knows that all the blobs are unique, so if this one has the same shape, it must be Jeremy!”<br>
            “But that’s impossible!” the other prisoners cried. “Surely you know that the blobs die when they go to the right!”<br>
            “Well, maybe they don’t!” the old man retorted. “Maybe Jeremy has survived, somehow!”<br>
            “Ah, but there’s a flaw in your logic, old man,” a middle-aged prisoner remarked. “If Jeremy went right, then how could they now have come from the left? Surely if Jeremy did somehow survive going right, then they would have to come back from the right!” All the other prisoners agreed: this just couldn’t be Jeremy.<br><br>
            “Fools!” the old man shouted. “Flat-minded fools! You see only what is in front of you! You take for fact only what you have been told! Look beyond the plain and obvious, and imagine what might exist! Couldn’t it be that there are other forces at play here, a world beyond the right that we don’t know about? Oh, if only Jeremy could hear us! If only they could tell us what they have seen, where they have been, what a marvellous story they could tell...” But the others ignored him, and went back to naming the new blob. Eventually, they decided on Jennifer. The old man was so distraught, he shut his eyes and never opened them again.<br><br>
            On and on, the cycle <span class="clickable" id="continue">continued.</span></p>

        <h2>2. Outsiders</h2>
        <p>Outside, a father and son watched the mobile <span class="clickable" id="change3">spin.</span></p>
        <p>“What is it, daddy?” the boy asked.<br>
            “That’s a good question, son,” the father replied. “It’s a piece of art, I know that for sure, but I don’t have the slightest idea what it’s supposed to do.” Observing the light in the center of the mobile, he reconsidered. “Maybe it’s a lamp?”<br>
            “It goes around and around!” the boy grinned, delighted by the motion. “And look, it has little ones of itself inside!”<br>
            “Hmf. What’ll these artists think of next?” With that, the father and son shuffled off.<br><br><br><br><br>
            A woman approached the mobile next.<br>
            She watched it spin for a while, and noticed the little knots hovering inside on near-invisible strings. Crouching to get a closer look, the light shined into her eyes, making her squint. Then, she had an idea.<br>
            Holding her hand out to the side of the mobile, she saw the mobile again from a new perspective. The light inside acted as a projector, casting the shadow of the little spinning knots onto her palm. Slowly, the knot glided out of view, and after a while, the next one came around. She watched as the twisting knots made different blobby shapes, slowly changing as they made their way around the mobile. She supposed that if one could only see the shadow cast by the mobile from one angle, they might never see the same blob twice -- or at least, it might take a very long time. That made her a bit sad.<br>
            But seen another way, it might be quite wonderful. Always presented with new and curious shapes, supplied just with this mobile of four knots. That wasn’t so bad, she decided.<br>
            As she watched the little world spin by on her palm, she thought about the other perspectives you could view the mobile from. The little blobs were in reality a negative of another world, viewed from the center of the mobile. She imagined the tiny knots as planets, orbiting their bulb sun. She traced her finger along the edge of the mobile, and tried to picture what a surface map of it would look like. She saw all of these tiny worlds, and wondered what would happen to them if the mobile were to suddenly <span class="clickable" id="change4">stop.</span><br>
            The woman shook her head, and checked the time. The side of the knot she lived on would turn away from the giant bulb in the sky soon. Perhaps tomorrow, she would <span class="clickable" id="return">return.</span></p>
